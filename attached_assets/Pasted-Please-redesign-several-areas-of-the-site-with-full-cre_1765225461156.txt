Please redesign several areas of the site with full creative autonomy, while keeping the overall brand identity, colors, typography, and premium editorial tone consistent.

You have permission to:
- Design unique layouts for different sections
- Choose animation styles
- Choose hover interactions and motion patterns
- Modify card structures, grid layouts, and hero sections
- Add subtle movement, transitions, and depth to enhance user experience
- Make design decisions independently as long as they align with the site’s current aesthetic

DO NOT change navigation structure, page routing, or existing text unless needed for layout.

------------------------------------
1. GLOBAL EXPERIENCE UPGRADE
------------------------------------
• Add a site-wide animation system:
  - fade-in on scroll
  - slide-up for text blocks
  - staggered image reveals
  - soft zoom hover effects for cards
  - parallax scroll for hero images
• Add improved button interactions with gentle lift, gold accent shift, and arrow animation.
• Enhance nav interactions with animated gold underlines and slight brightness changes.

Keep animations elegant and minimal — premium editorial quality.

------------------------------------
2. CONTENT PAGE UPGRADE
------------------------------------
Redesign the “Content” page with only two tabs:
- Instagram
- TikTok

You may redesign these however you think best:
• Add platform-specific styling
• Use unique hover animations for each platform
• Add visual previews, mock feed cards, or animated tiles
• Implement motion that fits social-media energy but still matches the site’s aesthetic

------------------------------------
3. UNIQUE LAYOUTS PER CATEGORY
------------------------------------
Redesign the page layout and review presentation style for each major section so they are NOT identical:

• NYC Eats  
• Cuisines  
• Top 10 Lists  
• College Budget Eats (Under $20)

Each section should have:
- A unique hero style (image, shape, gradient, animation)
- A distinct card layout (grids, staggered cards, mixed-size image tiles, or editorial columns)
- Different hover styles and motion patterns
- Slightly different spacing and hierarchy

Give each category its own personality while keeping the site cohesive.

Examples (you may choose your own approach):
- NYC Eats → energetic, city-style layout with animated map pins or staggered masonry grid.
- Cuisines → image-based tiles with subtle zoom and a global culinary vibe.
- Top 10 Lists → editorial magazine style with strong hierarchy and feature hero.
- Budget Eats → playful, bold design with price highlights and cheerful animations.

------------------------------------
4. TOP 10 LIST SUB-PAGE IMPROVEMENT
------------------------------------
Make each Top 10 sub-page visually distinct:
• Featured hero card  
• Unique background overlays  
• Animated list item reveal  
• Optional numbered badges or floating decorations  

------------------------------------
5. IMPLEMENT & APPLY DESIGNS
------------------------------------
Apply changes across all related files.  
Ensure everything works across desktop and mobile.

Use your full autonomy to design, animate, and style these pages for maximum visual appeal and professionalism.
