Please update the Cuisines section so that every “View All” button becomes fully functional. 
For each cuisine card, generate a dedicated page that lists all reviews for that cuisine using the same review-list layout/style already used on the site. 
Example routes include:
- /cuisines/steakhouse
- /cuisines/french
- /cuisines/spanish
- /cuisines/pizza
Each card’s “View All” link should take the user directly to its matching cuisine page.

Next, redesign the entire Cuisines page using image-based tiles instead of plain white cards.
Each cuisine tile should include:
- A full-bleed cuisine photo as the background
- A dark overlay (about 35–45%) for text readability
- The cuisine name in bold on top of the image
- The review count beneath the title
- A “View All” link or button at the bottom
All tiles should be clickable, visually consistent with the site’s theme, and use a modern grid layout. 
Add a subtle hover effect such as a soft shadow or gentle image zoom. 
Do not change page navigation or headings—only visually upgrade the cuisine cards.

Also, redesign the “Top 10 Lists” page to use a more editorial, premium layout.

1. Add a HERO CARD at the top:
   - Full-width or large wide card with a background image and dark overlay
   - Bold title (e.g., “Top 10 Date Night Spots”) plus a short subtitle
   - A clear “View List →” button
   - Entire card should be clickable
   - Add a light zoom-on-hover animation

2. Below the hero card, create a responsive grid for the remaining Top 10 lists:
   - Use image-based cards for each list category
   - Include the title, short description, and “View List →”
   - Use 2 columns on mobile and 3 on desktop
   - Apply rounded corners, consistent padding, and soft shadows
   - Background images should have a subtle dark gradient for readability

3. Improve UX with hover interactions:
   - Cards should slightly lift, scale, or shadow on hover
   - Make the entire card clickable rather than only the text link

Ensure all typography, spacing, and colors match the rest of the site’s existing theme. 
Do not modify the navigation bar or the page headings—only upgrade the layout, visuals, and clickable functionality.
